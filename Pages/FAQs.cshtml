        Washington state has opened weddings to full capacity. Masks will not be required, but feel free to wear one if it makes you feel safer.
        <br /> 
        We plan on video streaming the ceremony and will post details sooner to our wedding.

        We are watching the COVID-19 situation and currently are optimistic that there will be no restrictions in place for our wedding next year.
        <br />
        If there are any developments or updates, we will post them here.
